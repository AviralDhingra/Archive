You cannot define variables in between fo that code in 'C' like in other languages

Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, <<, >>, ~ (This is why the language gets a 'low-level' reputation)

- Functions Are there but not OOP
  - Functions are:
    - Held in C Libraries
    - Difned and supported by the header files
    - thousands of functions

## Basic syntax/structure for source code files in 'C'

1. Pre-processor Directives, header files, macros
2. External Objects, variables, declarations
3. "main()" functions
4. Custom (other) functions

### Note: Cryptic Or Readable By Deleting Or Having 'Whitespaces'

## Common C Default Functions

- printf() => Pritning the specified value (Strings & Variables)
- puts() => Pritning the specified value (Only Strings) (if you dont put '\n', it will not go to new tine and print right after the string before)

Deal With Charecters (Char), But Thier Value Is 'int'... Sream Oriented
& **Streamline** means it will ask all inputs (no matter the order) and then give the output

- putchar() => Another function for printing
- getchar() => Getting Input (Input comes in a stream of charecters, instead of pressing enter every time)
