Step by step guide for creating new project

1. Think and brainstorm about the usage for the project
2. Note down the main features you want ot add in that project in OneNote jsut as a start for visualizing
3. After the objective is clear - put all those task neatly in trello for seeing the progress clearly ---- Also create an issue card in trello
4. Now create a new directory as "Project_Project Number" --- Through git

IMPORTANT : CREATE A NEW ENVIORMENT FOR EVERY PROJECT AFTER CREATING THE DIRECTORY OTHERWISE IT WILL BE COMPLETELY USELESS

5. Now CD into that directory in Aaconda powershell prompt (for running) and Git Bash (for logs and creating files)
6. Inside that directory create a git init as well as a .gitignore file through git bash
7. Also create - a) Features.txt
		 b) Project_snippet.py --- Inside atom and keep it open
		 c) Main.py -- For the main code and possibily all the code
8. Then create a "saved_tests-results" folder inside the project folder --- through git
9. Save all the tests and important results in that folder

# ----- NOTE : KEEP TRACK OF THE GIT LOGS AND START WORKING

10. Also open a blank chrome page as well as the documentation page of all the libraries you are using just at the side
11. Use the single search Google app for quick searches and saving images (cover / logo / etc)
